                <h1 class="blog-post-title">Seek First the Kingdom</h1>
                <p class="blog-post-intro">Our partner in South Asia recently shared a powerful story from the field. One of the local leaders was struggling financially and had run out of options to provide food for his household.</p>

                <div class="blog-post-body">
                    <p>Each day, the husband walked from village to village selling Bibles without much success. His wife kept praying that their family &mdash; herself, her husband, and their young son &mdash; would stay strong and not go hungry.</p>

                    <p>On the sixth day without food, the family traveled to a nearby village to share the Gospel. As they passed through, one home caught the wife's eye. She stopped and asked if she could speak with the people inside. The man at the door told her no, as they were just about to leave; but she gently insisted, saying she only wanted to offer a quick prayer.</p>

                    <h2>A Life-Saving Moment</h2>
                    <p>Reluctantly, they agreed. But as soon as she began to pray, a young boy in the back of the house began to cry &mdash; loudly enough for everyone to hear. Shocked, the family rushed to him and asked what was wrong.</p>
                    <p>After a long pause, the boy shared that if the visitors hadn't come, he wouldn't be alive. He confessed that he had planned to take his life that very day.</p>
                    <p>The entire household wept at the news and thanked the woman for her prayer. They begged the visiting family to stay for lunch. At first, she declined and told them of her commitment to praying for others; but after much insistence, they agreed to join the meal.</p>

                    <h2>God's Faithful Provision</h2>
                    <p>As they ate, the mother watched her son joyfully enjoying the food, grateful for his full stomach, but silently worried about where their next meal would come from. She hoped he would eat as much as he could, knowing there was no food waiting at home.</p>
                    <p>When it came time to leave, the host family came out with a large bag of rice, flour, onions, potatoes, oil &mdash; everything a family might need. They offered it as a gift of gratitude.</p>
                    <p>The woman hesitated, saying, "You don't need to give us all this! And besides, how could we carry something so heavy such a long way home?"</p>
                    <p>But the host family insisted, and even offered to personally drive them and the supplies back.</p>

                    <blockquote>They praised God for His provision and for the miracle He had worked in more than one life that day. In that moment, the woman made a commitment: no matter what happens, she will never stop sharing the Good News.</blockquote>

                    <p>We are honored to support and empower faithful followers of Jesus like her.</p>
